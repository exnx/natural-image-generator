# Natural Image Generator

This script will take a directory of font ttf files (say from Google fonts), and generate
random natural images by letter and number, varying the color of the text, background and
other data augmentation techniques.  These include random applications of blur, gaussian noise, contrast,
translation, size, etc.

This will be used to train a binary classifier to tell if two characters have the same font or not.
